# Shopping Cart Kata

## The Task

You are implementing a simple checkout system, there are four products available, each with a price per unit. Some products have a special price when bought in certain quantities (e.g. 3 of product A costs 140, not 150). Implement a checkout system that allows items to be “scanned” via their Item Code, and returns the sub total when queried. 

## Dataset

| Item Code |	Unit Price | Special Price |
|:---------:|:----------:|:-------------:|
|     A	    |     50	   |    3 for 140  |
|     B     |   	35	   |    2 for 60   |
|     C     |   	25	   |               |
|     D     |   	12	   |               |
